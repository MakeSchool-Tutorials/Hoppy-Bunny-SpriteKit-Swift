Welcome to bonus stage, your challenge should you accept, is to work through the list of challenges and take your game to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students, it's good to collaborate and often results in new exciting directions.

If you have any challenge suggestions, we would love to hear them.  Please provide feedback at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Hoppy-Bunny-SpriteKit-Swift)

It would be a good idea to create a **new branch** in your repo for these challenges.

#Parallax scrolling

You currently have a single scrolling ground, how can you improve this?

Let's take a look at a classic:

![Mario Parallax](https://hallme.com/uploads/parallax-scrolling-mario.gif)

Notice the different layers of the background all scrolling at different speeds, this effect is called [Parallax Scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling)

> [challenge]
> Can you implement parallax scrolling?
> **Hint**: Try starting with the clouds, you already have a ground scrolling method...

#Progressive difficulty

The game starts hard and never quits... This was by design.  However, what if you wanted to ease the player in and progressively ramp up the difficulty?

> [challenge]
> How many ways can you think up to first of all make the game easier and how can you scale up the difficulty?

#Rewarding achievement

When the player passes through the obstacle, it's not very rewarding. How about adding a little sparkle to the event?

> [challenge]
> How many ways can you think of to make this experience more rewarding?
> **Hint**: We've already included a rewarding coin SFX in the project :]

#High score

When the player dies there is no display of the high score, it would be good to present this as a challenge for the next player!

> [challenge]
> Can you add a high score display mechanic?

#Button Node

The current implementation of *MSButtonNode* is intentionally simple, it would be great if the button could feedback that it's been touched.  This could be a combination of visual effects and/or sound effects.

> [challenge]
> Enhance *MSButtonNode*

If you make a nice *MSButtonNode* you should use it to enhance your own game projects.

#Summary

Congratulations on completing the bonus stage!
